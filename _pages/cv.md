Education
======
* B.S. in department of physics,Univerisity of Science and Technology of China, 2021-2025

Research experience
======
* University of Science and Technology of China, Trace Analysis Lab----Hefei, China
  Advisors: **Prof. Wei Jiang** and **Prof. Zhengtian Lu** Sep 2023 -  Present
  
  **Projects**:Precision measurement of VUV(Vacuum-UltraViolet) spectrum of a Krypton lamp
  * Designed a two-photon resonance method to measure the VUV spectrum of a Krypton lamp, which eliminates the need for high-precision VUV optical apparatus.
  * Implemented the designed two-photon method using the ATTA (Atom Trap Trace Analysis) system to confirm the VUV lamp's self-reversal spectrum experimentally and reached a precision of 100 MHz.
  * Confirmed the validity of our description of the photon imprisonment mechanism inside plasma, in contrast to the widely used Lambert-Beer Law.
* Helmholtz Institute Mainz, Budker Group----Mainz, Germany
  Advisors: **Dr. Hendrik Bekker** and **Prof. Dmitry Budker** Jul 2024 -  Oct 2024
  
  **Projects**:Loading positron into RF (Radio Frequency) trap (part of AMOC-AntiMatter On Chip project)
  * Developed two proposals (through positronium or through high-quality positron pulses by Buffer gas trap) for loading positrons into the existing RF trap, eventually to make antihydrogen in a university laboratory, offering a more accessible alternative to the CERN facility.
  * Developed a test platform to evaluate the production of metastable positronium , aiming to provide critical knowledge for potential candidate of positronium convertors.
  * Developed a cost-efficient Monte-Carlo program to evaluate the efficiency of the Buffer gas trap, providing advice on trap design.
  * Proposed a compact two-stage buffer gas trap design combined with fast turn-up of RF trap, aiming to provide high quality positron pulses and make loading possible.
