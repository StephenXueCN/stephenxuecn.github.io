To be honest, I first noticed this game is because of many NSFW shots of Yeniffer. And after the high school entrance examination
 I finally have enough time to spend on it. At that time, my parents still considered the video game to be a distraction from my study so my tool
 for this east euro journey has to be the small laptop borrowed from my mom which even has no independant GPU. So I 
 even invented a method to complement such scenario that is to run the game in the lowest resolution and in windows mode 
 while use the microsoft magnifier(because the full screen mode will crush on that laptop.)
